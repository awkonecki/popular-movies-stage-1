## Project Goals
The goals listed below are a copy from the Udacity project page.

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.

  - The sort order can varry based on supported types (popularity, rating, name etc).
- Allow the user to tap a poster and transition to a details screen with additional information.
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - plot synopsis (overview)
  - user rating (vote_average)

This project is to showcase developing a new project from scratch given a rough set of desired ideas.  Due to the content this will require the developer to connect to an external API, handle background processes, support an interactive UI
